📊 Jio Recharge Data Science & Power BI Dashboard
Data Science project analyzing Jio recharge trends using synthetic data. Covers data generation, cleaning, feature engineering, trend analysis, forecasting, and visualization. Insights help optimize plans, promotions, and resources. Includes optional interactive Power BI dashboard

🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes Jio Recharge Dataset (synthetic but realistic) to uncover recharge patterns, forecast demand, and provide data-driven business insights. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for data generation, cleaning, and trend analysis, and Power BI for interactive dashboarding, the project demonstrates how telecom companies like Jio can make smarter decisions in network planning, marketing, and customer engagement.

🔑 Key Highlights

✅ Synthetic Dataset – 20,000+ recharge transactions across multiple cities, plan types, and payment modes (generated using Python).

✅ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering – handled missing values, outliers, duplicates, and added time-based features like Year, Month, Week, Weekend flag.

✅ Trend Analysis & Forecasting – analyzed daily, weekly, and monthly recharge trends to identify growth patterns, seasonal spikes, and city-level insights.

✅ Business Recommendations – actionable suggestions for capacity planning, weekend campaigns, UPI promotion, and city-specific strategies.

✅ Power BI Dashboard – interactive visuals with slicers for city, plan type, payment mode, recharge type, year, and month.

📌 Insights & Recommendations

1️⃣ Recharge volumes grow steadily with monthly/annual peaks → prepare capacity & run targeted offers before peak cycles.
2️⃣ Weekends see more recharges & UPI is the most preferred mode → launch weekend campaigns & incentivize low-cost UPI transactions.
3️⃣ Metro cities dominate in volume but tier-2 cities grow fastest → balance investments: scale in metros & pilot localized offers in emerging cities.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python → Data generation, cleaning, and trend forecasting

Pandas / NumPy → Data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn → Visualization
